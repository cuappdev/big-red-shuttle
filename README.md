# BRShuttle - Cornell Big Red Shuttle

<p align="center"><img src=https://github.com/cuappdev/assets/blob/master/big-red-shuttle/BRS-Long-Logo.png?raw=true width=600 /></p>

BRShuttle is the third app made by [CUAppDev](http://cuappdev.org), an engineering project team at Cornell University focused on mobile app development. The [Big Red Shuttle](http://www.cornellbigredshuttle.com/) is Cornell's first free, student-run, late-night transportation service for students in need of a safe ride home. It strives to promote a safer campus climate to prevent alcohol-related incidents and sexual assault. The Big Red Shuttle runs a 20-minute route every Friday and Saturday from 12am-3am with a professional paid driver and two managers trained by Cayuga's Watchers. The BRShuttle app complements the BRS service by allowing students to view the shuttle route and time schedule so that they can find the quickest and safest way back home. You can view our [release notes](RELEASENOTES.md) to learn more about the progress of BRShuttle. Download the current release on the [Apple App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/brshuttle-cornell-big-red/id1180295401?ls=1&mt=8).
